# AI4IA : Artificial Intelligence for Industrial Application

The challenge AI4IA was organized by [SKF](https://www.skf.com/fr) and hosted by [Agorize](https://www.agorize.com/fr/challenges/ai4ia?lang=fr). The goal of the challenge was designed as followed : we had `input` signals and `output` signals (1 input signal was assigned with 5 output signals). The goal was to predict the 5 output signals along time given 1 input signal.

This Github repository provides my solution to this problem

* This [markdown](explanation.md) explains how my solution was designed and built
* The folder `src` contains my Python code
* The folder `data` contains the data provided by the challenge
* This [notebook](notebook/notebook.ipynb) shows the solution in action
